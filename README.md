Dodgy Blocks
=============

A humble game made using Raylib library and C++.  
Made - with love, anger, patience and much more - by Alaa Arees (Phoenix).  
All music and sound contents in the game are made by the Minecraft-ish dude, best  
young Syrian music producer, AND, our dear friend: Ali Ibrahim (Beyond Electric).  
Special thanks to Lamak Al-Akkari for testing the game and suggesting various game  
content ideas.  
And Special thanks to those who helped, supported, trusted and encouraged me to continue  
this small project during some very rough times... Without you, I would've had given up  
developing this game long time ago.

Compiling:
-----------
first download and install raylib library from https://www.raylib.com/  
then open this project's makefile (it's in the same folder as the file you are reading  
right now) and add the appropriate path to raylib on your machine, everything  
should be fine to compile now by opening a terminal and changing to the project's  
directory then invoke your 'make' executable (`make` or `mingw32-make`).  
**If you've only downloaded the game files without the source code, you can download the*  
*source from the link below in 'Resources' section.*  
**NOTE:** There are only binaries for the game for Windows on Itch.io, but since Dodgy Blocks'
only external dependency is raylib you should be able to download the appropriate raylib
version on your platform and compile the game, just make sure to configure CFLAGS and
LDFLAGS to be suitable for the C++ compiler you intend to use...
