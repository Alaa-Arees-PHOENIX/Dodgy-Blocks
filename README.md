Dodgy Blocks
=============

A simple game made using raylib library and C++.
Made by Alaa Arees (Phoenix).


Compiling:
-----------
first download and install raylib library from <TODO: add link here>
then open this project's makefile (it's in the same folder as the file you are reading
right now) and add the appropriate path to raylib on your machine, everything
should be fine to compile now by opening a terminal and changing to the project's
directory then type `make` or `mingw32-make`.


Notes:
-----------
- 	NAMING CONVENTIONS: variables defined by Dodgy_Blocks' code follows this pattern "variableName"
	functions defined by Dodgy_Blocks' code follows this pattern "function_name ()"
	functions defined by raylib's code/headers follows this pattern "FunctionName ()"
	
- 	The project is structured to have two files for each class or translation unit.
	The first is a header file ".hpp" and the other is a source file ".cpp".
	The header file contains only prototypes and class declarations and the ".cpp" provides the
	implementation of those functions.
